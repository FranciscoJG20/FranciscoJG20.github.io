                    <br>
                    <p class="font-weight-light about-p"> Francisco is a Brooklyn-based writer and software engineer.</p>
                    <p class="about-p">His varying work experience — from grassroots organizing for a political organization to leading corporate training workshops and introducing employees to emerging technologies — informed Francisco's eagerness to amplify human stories currently ignored by mainstream media. 
                            Francisco has recently written and led content development for <a href="https://www.2050.work">2050Work</a>, a job board specifically for job seekers of color in tech and creative. He previously wrote for San Francisco paper, <a href="http://eltecolote.org/content/en/">El Tecolote</a>, where he started his own column, <i>"Latinxs Redefining Tech"</i> and highlighted the positive impact that Latinos (gender-inclusive) are having in the technology industry. 
                            Additionally, Francisco has written about technology and his <a href="https://medium.com/faun/what-in-the-world-is-devops-a-conversation-with-david-arias-devops-engineer-at-oracle-8561240571a5">interview</a> with Oracle DevOps Engineer was published in Faun, a growing community of devops, full-stack engineers and IT professionals.</p> 
                    <p class="about-p">Francisco holds a B.S. in Marketing from Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business and is a former employee and alumnus of General Assembly. </p>

                                "In my 5+ years of work as a software development educator and engineering manager, I’ve come across few technologists like Francisco who can simultaneously facilitate spaces of learning and personal growth for their colleagues while delivering high-quality code and timely product development. I was amazed at Francisco’s natural ability to collaborate with engineers at different levels of technical mastery. Francisco created dynamic team cohesion through highly effective project management and engineering leadership that is horizontal and inclusive in nature.

Francisco immediately offered support. He helped my team refine our questions and create a survey that our entire team volunteered to participate in. With Francisco’s questions and suggestions, we built a survey we were proud of, and more importantly, gave us the insight into our team to create a strong D&I action plan. I’m happy I was able to work with Francisco on this, and I hope we get the chance to work together again!"
